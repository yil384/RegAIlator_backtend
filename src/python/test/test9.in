PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)

Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (hereafter abbreviated as PFAS) are a group of extremely
persistent chemicals that are used in many consumer products. PFAS are used in products because they
can, for example, increase oil and water repellency or withstand high temperatures. Currently, there are
more than 4700 different PFAS that accumulate in humans and the environment.

PartsBadger, LLC (PartsBadger) hereby declares that all PartsBadger products do not contain PFAS.

PartsBadger does not directly purchase any PFAS.

PartsBadger products have been manufactured without the intentional use of PFAS.

We have communicated our requirements to our suppliers to ensure that PFAS are not used in our
products. We have subsequently obtained declarations from our suppliers confirming their commitment
and upstream due diligence.

PartsBadger is diligently working to ensure that our supply chain is and remains free of PFAS. Please
contact us if you have any further questions about our program.
