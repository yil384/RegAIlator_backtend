Hello  Shelly,

 

Thank you for your inquiry.

We are currently conducting an investigation with our suppliers regarding the 'PFAS Data Reporting Requirements' under the TSCA.  

Depending on the response status of our suppliers, the timing of when we can provide a response is currently undecided.  

We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. 

 

Thank you,
