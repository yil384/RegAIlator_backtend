Hi Sherry,

 

McMaster-Carr is a US-based distributor of over half-a-million products, most of which are procured from US sources. We are aware that various domestic and international regulations related to PFAS have been proposed and are at differing stages of being decided upon. As regulators pass final rulings and effective restriction dates become known, we will work with our suppliers to understand how our products are affected. In addition, none of our suppliers have notified us that any of the products they sell to McMaster-Carr are affected. We are closely monitoring information released regarding PFAS.

 

We are not able to provide a blanket PFAS statement for the more than half-a-million items that we sell. Please let us know if you have questions about a specific item or PO number. 

 

Dana

Hello Jennifer

 

Thank you for your prompt response.

We understand your facility may not be subject to Canada’s PFAS reporting requirements. However, because the Bio-Techne final products—made with components purchased from your facility—may be imported into Canada, they will fall under the PFAS reporting rule.

 

Therefore, we would greatly appreciate your assistance in determining whether any of the components we purchased contain PFAS substances.

Thanks

Hi Sherry,

 

As a non-resident importer, Canadian PFAS reporting requirements do not apply to McMaster-Carr.

 

Jennifer
