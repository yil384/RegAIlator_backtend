The Sun Chemical regulatory statement is attached.
California Proposition 65
We have reviewed the subject product(s) for chemical substances currently listed on the California
Proposition 65 as either carcinogens or reproductive toxins. Any of these substances present at trace
levels as an unintentionally added impurity or added as a raw material are listed in the table below:

The reported amounts of the California Proposition 65 listed chemicals in our finished products are
derived (calculated) from the most current information obtained from our raw materials’ suppliersSun Chemical Corporation

Customers and their third-party contractors in order that they may demonstrate suitability for their specific applications, and compliance with

Compliance with California Proposition 65 means that you have informed people (employees, downstream
users) that a chemical listed on California Prop 65 is present.
Compliance does not mean that inks do not contain Prop 65-listed chemicals.
Inks and coatings may contain very low levels (< 0.001%) of not intentionally added Prop 65 chemicals in
which our raw materials suppliers have advised us that trace impurities may be present. California
Proposition 65 does not specify an absolute cut-off limit for the listed chemicals. Therefore, Sun Chemical
will report the Prop 65 chemicals even when they are present in very low trace quantities.
The state of California has issued some Safe Harbor Levels (SHL) for Proposition 65 carcinogens and
chemicals causing birth defects. These Safe Harbor Levels are expressed in terms of exposure guidelines
related cancer statistics over a lifetime or reproductive toxicity data for humans or animals. The SHL are not
expressed as concentrations. Therefore, Sun Chemical cannot determine if the final package or substrate
exposed people above the Safe Harbor levels. Furthermore, many chemicals on the California Proposition
65 list do not have these Safe Harbor levels.
The Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which Sun Chemical supplies to customers located in California indicates
any Proposition 65 materials that are present. Sun Chemical can provide this information on products we
supply but we cannot advise the customer as to their labeling obligations for printed products that they
manufacture and supply to their customers in California.
Ozone Depleting Substances
The subject product is formulated and manufactured without the use of any Class I CFC’s
(chlorofluorocarbons) or Class II HCFC’s (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) Ozone Depleting Compounds as
defined under the Clean Air Act Amendments.
TSCA
Please be advised that all of the products supplied by Sun Chemical are in compliance with TSCA.
Directives: 1935/2004/EC and 2023/2006/EC
1935/2004/EC is the Food Contact Materials Framework Regulation and applies to food contact
materials. It does not apply to the wet inks supplied by Sun Chemical; it does apply to the printed food
packaging. It requires that the packaging is manufactured according to good manufacturing practice (as
specified in GMP Regulation 2023/2006/EC), that there is traceability of food contact materials, and that
the food contact material in its finished state does not transfer components from the packaging to the
foodstuff in quantities which could endanger human health or change unacceptably the composition or
organoleptic properties of the packaged foodstuff.Sun Chemical Corporation
