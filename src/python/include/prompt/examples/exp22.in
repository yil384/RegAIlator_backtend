Toxics in Packaging (formerly CONEG) and 94/62/EC Packaging and Packaging Waste
Directive
Dear Valued Customer:
This letter is applicable to all printing ink and coating products supplied by Sun Chemical’s Printing
Ink and Performance Pigments Operations
Toxics in Packaging (formerly CONEG) and 94/62/EC
Please be advised that all products supplied by Sun Chemical are in compliance with US Toxics
in Packaging (formerly CONEG) and EU 94/62/EC heavy metals legislation.
All our products are formulated and manufactured without the intentional addition of materials
based on chemistries of lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium or mercury.
Levels of contaminating heavy metals, soluble in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, expressed as content
in dried ink film is:
Antimony (Sb)
< 125 ppm
Arsenic (As)
< 25 ppm
Cadmium (Cd)
< 25 ppm
Chromium (Cr)
< 50 ppm
Lead (Pb)
< 50 ppm
Mercury (Hg)
< 12 ppm
Selenium (Se)
< 50 ppm
The total content of lead, mercury, chromium and cadmium combined is less than 100 ppm.
*Nota bene: Random analyses of printing inks for heavy metal content indicate that typical levels
are significantly lower than the limiting values above.The information stated herein is provided to our Customers and their third-party contractors in order that they may
demonstrate suitability for their specific applications, and compliance with applicable Governmental Regulations or
Brand Owner Specifications. Sun Chemical provides this information without guarantee for the converted materials and

As part of Sun Chemical’s product stewardship program all raw materials purchased and utilized
by Sun Chemical must be certified by the suppliers that they are in compliance with Toxics in
Packaging (no intentional of addition of materials based on lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium
or mercury and that the incidental contaminant level is less than 100-ppm) before a raw material
will be approved for purchase.
94/62/EC Noxious and Hazardous Substances
Sun Chemical’s products can contain components which are classified as dangerous for the
environment. However, the dried ink film is not hazardous, and virtually none of these components
are available for release to the environment.
The only environmentally hazardous substances used in printing ink and coating products which
are likely to be released into the environment are the biocides which are used in water-borne
products. Biocide is added to prolong the shelf-life of the product, preventing bacteriological
deterioration. Its use is kept to a minimum consistent with the required technical performance.
The volume and weight of packaging used for our products is the minimum adequate amount
required to maintain the necessary level of safety, technical performance and acceptability for the
customer. Consequently, our products, when used as packaging constituents, will allow the
printed packaging to meet the requirements of Articles 9 and 11 of Directive 94/62/EC in so far
as they apply.
Sincerely,
James Tucker
Regulatory Affairs Manager, Printing Ink
