Nanomaterials have been widely promoted as being new, and technologically advanced materials that
possess unique and novel properties which will bring significant benefits to society. As a consequence,
this has raised concerns amongst the public, non-governmental organizations and regulatory authorities
about the potential that these new materials may possess toxicological properties not previously
observed when exposed to humans and the environment.
As generally understood a nanomaterial contains primary particles that measure 1-100 nanometers in
one or more dimension. In the recently published US EPA Nanomaterials Reporting Regulation (82 FR
3641) additional requirements were added. The material should be a solid at 25oC, and that it possesses
unique and novel properties not associated with other forms or sizes of the same chemical substance. This
regulation is a reporting requirement and does not impose any limitations or restrictions on manufacture,
sales or usage.
For several years we have been expecting a regulation in the EU, but the Commission has not at this time
presented a proposal while waiting for the completion of several reviews and studies that are intended to better
define the scope and need for nanomaterials to be regulated.
In lieu of an EU wide regulation, national reporting requirements have been established in France, Denmark and
Belgium. The scope of each of these regulations’ places different reporting requirements on material manufactured
or sold in these countries. Sun Chemical has continued to monitor the development of these new regulations and
ensures that we are ensuring that we meet these new requirements as they come into effect.
In developing these regulations, the unfortunate consequence is that chemical substances that are naturally
occurring or have been in commerce for many decades have come under scrutiny and reporting requirements.
This includes inorganic and organic pigments, along with many natural and synthetic fillers and additives
commonly used in conjunction with pigment. Organic pigments have never been offered in a “macro” version, as
such a version would lack the performance properties that make them of commercial value.
When customers use pigments to prepare inks, coatings and colored plastics, the presence of polymeric
materials leads to encapsulation of the otherwise dust pigments into a matrix, reducing potential worker and
environmental exposure.
Sun Chemical Corporation continues to actively participate in national and international associations related to
pigments. These associations continue to work with the regulatory authorities as they continue to develop
regulations on the continued safe use of pigments.
Please feel free to contact us should you have further questions.
