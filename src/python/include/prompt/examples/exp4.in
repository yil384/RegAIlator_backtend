Printing Inks for Food Packaging
The safety of food contact materials and articles is governed by the European Union’s Framework
Regulation (EC) No 1935/20041, which stipulates that materials and articles in contact with food,
whether printed or not, must not transfer to the foodstuffs any of their components which could
endanger human health or bring about any unacceptable change in the composition of the
foodstuffs or a deterioration in their organoleptic properties.
Printing inks are mentioned in Annex I, but there is not yet any specific legislation concerning
printing inks for food packaging, with the exception of Directive 2007/42/EC relating to regenerated
cellulose films, which states that the printed surface must not come into direct contact with food.
Switzerland amended their “Ordinance on Materials and Articles in Contact with Food’2 with provi-
sions on food packaging inks. This introduced a “list of permissible substances”. That amendment
came into force on 1st April 2008 with a transitional period of two years; hence the requirement has
been applicable since April 2010. In May 2011, the Annex of this Swiss Ordinance was changed
and some new evaluated substances were included. In December 2016 a new amendment was
published, telling that annex 6 will be replaced by annex 10; both came into force on 1st May 2017,
but with a transition period of four years for all products being placed on the market before that
date, applying to the section 12, as laid down in Article 95 (2) of the superordinate Lebensmittel-
und Gebrauchsgegenständeverordnung (LGV) SR 817.2.
In France there is a recommendation3 concerning the use of colourants and solvents in packaging
inks applied to the non-food contact surface of food packaging.
The main specific measure pursuant to the Framework Regulation is Regulation (EU) No 10/2011
relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. It lays down
an overall migration limit (OML) of 60 mg/kg food or 10 mg/dm² of surface area. In addition,
specific migration limits (SML) or maximum contents in the material or article (QM) are set for
individual substances. The Regulation contains a positive list of monomers and other starting
substances as well as additives. Substances used only in the manufacture of printing inks are not
listed, and thus packaging inks are not under the scope of this Regulation. However, for ink
components which are listed, the relevant restrictions such as specific migration limits (SML) or
maximum content (QM) have to be met.
The German BfR Recommendations (BfR = Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) do exclusively
apply to intended direct food contact applications and thus do not cover packaging inks applied in
outside or intermediate layer printing.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food additives (direct or indirect) in the
Code of Federal Regulations 21CFR §170-190. Printing inks for external or intermediate layer
printing are not regulated because the ink components are not reasonably expected to become a
part of the food when employing appropriate good manufacturing practices.

Having regard to these facts EuPIA (European Printing Ink Association, a sector of CEPE, the
European Council of the Paint, Printing Ink and Artists’ Colours Industry) has prepared the “EuPIA
Guideline on Printing Inks applied on the non-food contact surface of food packaging materials and
articles” (http://www.eupia.org).
The Council of Europe (CoE) Committee of Experts on Food Contact Materials published a
Resolution ResAP(2005)2 on packaging inks. EuPIA takes the position that it is an effectively
incomplete and unworkable document because for example the inventory lists of raw materials
provided with the Resolution are incomplete and many key materials are missing. Compared to the
CoE Resolution the EuPIA Guideline is much more comprehensive.
The Commission GMP Regulation (EC) No 2023/20064, which applies from 1 August 2008,
introduces general rules on quality assurance and control systems as well as detailed
requirements – at the moment only concerning the application of printing inks to the non-food
contact side of materials and articles.
Sun Chemical continues to supply inks employing the concepts of the EuPIA Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) and the EuPIA Guideline. This reflects and fits with the principles of the EU
Commission GMP Regulation. In addition we follow the recommendations of the various bodies to
give maximum support to the packaging manufacturer to meet the criteria of the Framework
Regulation.
Following the EuPIA Exclusion List the selected raw materials (substances or preparations) are not
classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to reproduction of category 1 or 2 (T), toxic (T) or very
toxic (T+) according to the Dangerous Substances Directive (DSD) 67/548/EEC.
Pigments are not based on heavy metals; they meet the purity requirements of the Council of
Europe (CoE) Resolution AP(89)1 or the BfR Recommendation IX with regard to heavy metal
contaminants.
Azo dyes which can decompose in the body to bio-available carcinogenic aromatic amines of
category 1 and 2 according to Directive 67/548/EEC are not used.
The food packaging inks are formulated in such a way as to both minimise potential migration
through the substrate and the set-off from the printed outer side to the food contact surface in the
stack or reel. Note that set-off and migration are also dependent on the processing conditions and
sufficient barrier properties of the substrate. The legislation on food contact material and toy safety
considers also the risk of the hazardous substances setting appropriate limits to protect public
health.
According to the statements of the suppliers the pigments meet the requirements concerning
heavy metal impurities of the EC Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste and the
US Regulations of the Coalition of North Eastern Governors (CONEG). Consequently, printing inks
supplied by Sun Chemical will comply with these provisions regardless of the definitions of
‘packaging’ and ‘packaging component’ that may be used in legislation.
