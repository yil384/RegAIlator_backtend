Compliance with California Proposition 65 means that you have informed people (employees,
downstream users) that a chemical listed on California Prop 65 is present.
Compliance does not mean that inks do not contain Prop 65-listed chemicals.
Inks and coatings may contain very low levels of not intentionally added Prop 65 chemicals in
which our raw materials suppliers have advised us that trace contaminant impurities may be
present. California Proposition 65 does not specify an absolute cut-off limit for the listed
chemicals. Therefore, Sun Chemical will report the Prop 65 chemicals even when they are
present in very low trace quantities.
The state of California has issued some Safe Harbor Levels (SHL) for Proposition 65
carcinogens and chemicals causing birth defects. These Safe Harbor Levels are expressed in
terms of exposure guidelines related cancer statistics over a lifetime or reproductive toxicity data
for humans or animals. The SHL are not expressed as concentrations. Therefore, Sun Chemical
cannot determine if the final package or substrate exposed people above the Safe Harbor
levels. Furthermore, many chemicals on the California Proposition 65 list do not have these
Safe Harbor levels.
The Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS or SDS) which Sun Chemical supplies to customers
located in California indicates any Proposition 65 materials that are present. Sun Chemical can
provide this information on products we supply but we cannot advise the customer as to their
labeling obligations for printed products that they manufacture and supply to their customers in
California.
Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)
All the products supplied by Sun Chemical are formulated and manufactured without the use of
Class I or Class II ozone depleting chemicals as defined under Section 611 of the Clean Air Act.
National Inventories
Please see the product SDS.
EU Framework Regulation 1935/2004/EC and EU GMP Regulation 2023/2006/EC
1935/2004/EC is the Food Contact Materials Framework Regulation and applies to food contact
materials. It does not apply to the wet inks supplied by Sun Chemical; it does apply to the
printed food packaging. It requires that the packaging is manufactured according to good
manufacturing practice (as specified in GMP Regulation 2023/2006/EC), that there is traceability
of food contact materials, and that the food contact material in its finished state does not
transfer components from the packaging to the foodstuff in quantities which could endanger
human health or change unacceptably the composition or organoleptic properties of the
packaged foodstuff.The information stated herein is based on current Sun Chemical formulations and available raw material compositions. It is provided to our
Customers and their third-party contractors in order that they may demonstrate suitability for their specific applications, and compliance with

Mineral Oil
Article 112 of the French Decree No. 2020-1725 on the ‘Fight Against Waste and the Circular
Economy’ regulates the use of mineral oil on packaging and free advertising. The article
prohibits mineral oil containing substances that interfere with waste recycling and provides the
following definitions:
•
MOH = Mineral Oil Hydrocarbons
•
MOAH = Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons consisting of 1 to 7 aromatic cycles
•
MOSH = Mineral Oil Saturated Hydrocarbons consisting of 16 to 35 carbon atoms
The first restrictions come in from 01/01/2023 and run till 01/01/2025 wherein printing inks
containing more than 1% of MOAH are banned. Then from 01/01/2025 printing inks containing
more than 0.1% of MOAH (1-7 aromatic cycles) (or more than 1 ppm of MOAH (3-7 aromatic
cycles)) or more than 0.1% of MOSH (C16-C35) are banned.
The subject products are compliant to the 2023 thresholds for MOSH and MOAH.
Due to MOH ubiquitous use in industry and beyond, the presence of traces of mineral oils
arising from impurities, or from processing or other contaminants cannot be excluded.  We are
discussing the limits for 2025 with our suppliers in order to establish compliance for 2025 limits.
The 1 ppm limit for MOAH with 3-7 cyclic aromatic rings is of concern.The information stated herein is based on current Sun Chemical formulations and available raw material compositions. It is provided to our
Customers and their third-party contractors in order that they may demonstrate suitability for their specific applications, and compliance with

Furthermore, there are no analytical methods currently available able to determine the source of
any substances that are detected that are chemically identical to MOSH/MOAH, which can lead
to misidentification of non-mineral oil source substances as MOSH/MOAH.
