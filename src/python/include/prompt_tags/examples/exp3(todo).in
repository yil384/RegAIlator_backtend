1.1. Survey:

Dear Supplier

As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure health, safety, and environmental responsibility, we are reviewing the chemical composition of all sourced materials and components.
In particular, we are currently examining the presence of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in our supply chain. Canada’s PFAS reporting requirement is a mandate to report on the manufacture, import, and use of PFAS. For further reference, please see Canada’s guidance on PFAS reporting requirements here: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/evaluating-existing-substances/pfas-s71-guidance-manual.html#toc4. The deadline to submit the relevant PFAS report is January 29, 2025.

 

In order to ensure compliance, we kindly request that you reply to this email with a PFAS statement addressing the following points for any PFAS present in the products we purchased from you in 2023:

 

PFAS Presence and Concentration:
o    Confirm whether any PFAS are used in the product’s manufacturing process or appear in the final product.
o    If present, please provide details on which PFAS compounds are involved along with the below information for the compound:
      - CAS number;
      - Intended use;
      - Approximate concentrations;
      - Scope of the impacted products including product part number and its description; and 
      - Total volume of the product containing PFAS shipped to Bio-Techne in 2023.

 

We would greatly appreciate receiving your written statement by January 10, 2025. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact Sherry Wang at sherry.wang@bio-techne.com.
Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Warm regards,
